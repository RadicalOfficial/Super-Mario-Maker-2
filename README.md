# Super Mario Maker 2
A Scratch Extension getting Super Mario Maker 2 data. Unofficial.

# Short Documentation
These blocks are easy to use. They connect to the [API from TGRCode](https://tgrcode.com). <br>**If you don't play Super Mario Maker 2, then you will probably not understand these blocks.**
<br><br>
So first, enter your desired Level ID in this block:
```javascript
get Super Mario Maker 2 level (91CMPM7LF)
```
The example provided will return correctly. If not, please contact me.

Then you can use these blocks:
```javascript
<Level Status Code is successful?>

(get level (title v))
```

<br>

> [!TIP]
> The same goes for the User ID blocks, and Ninji Speedruns but you have a wide selection of options

# Miscellaneous Blocks
These are blocks that can be used for other things besides getting data!


```javascript
get Level Thumbnail (level ID)
```
The block above will make a new Scratch Costume of the level thumbnail.

# Upcoming Updates
## These are the upcoming updaets for the Extension.
### Version 1.4
Getting First Clears, World Records, from a user.
*Note that only the counts will be accurate, level data from the list will be too large.*


# That's it!
If you ever find any bugs, please contact me on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Knightbot63/) or on the official forum topic.
